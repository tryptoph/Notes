**Physical layer**

- Represents the constructor's view
- Takes the logical security architecture designed in the previous layer and assigns a technological system that meets the functional requirement scoped out in the logical layer

**Component layer**

- Represents the technician's view
- Systems scoped out from the physical layer are integrated and built in this layer

**Management layer**

- Represents the manager's view
- Concerned with ensuring operational continuity and having a maintenance process in place for each layer.

### There are multiple possibilities for this solution. Here's a sample explanation:

**Contextual Layer:**

Business has a requirement to ensure there are safeguards in place against phishing attacks to prevent loss of reputation and money.

**Conceptual Layer:**

Architect conceptualizes that there needs to be email filtering in place before emails hit mail servers, phishing awareness training, and threat intelligence.

**Logical Layer:**

The designer scopes out the design of how to implement an email filtering solution before the mail servers, designing traffic and filtering rules. Designer also designs the scope for the phishing awareness training and how to implement threat intelligence into the architecture.

**Physical Layer:**

In this layer the constructor identifies components required to achieve the logical layer. So for email filtering we would use a secure email gateway to help filter out phishing attempts. We would also look for firewalls that can incorporate external threat intelligence. Lastly have a phishing awareness solution purchased or built for staff.

**Component Layer:**

In this layer, the technician is deploying the secure email gateway and the firewall and ensuring the integration works.

**Management Layer:**

In this layer, the manager is ensuring there is a maintenance lifecycle in place for the newly deployed secure email gateway as well as the firewall. Manager is also implementing a lifecycle for how often and when to run the phishing awareness training.
