>- **NIST SP 800-210** presents an initial step toward understanding security challenges in cloud systems by analyzing the access control (AC) considerations in all three cloud service delivery models—Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).
>- **NIST SP 800-181** describes the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Cybersecurity Workforce Framework (NICE Framework), a reference structure that describes the interdisciplinary nature of the cybersecurity work. It serves as a fundamental reference resource for describing and sharing information about cybersecurity work and the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) needed to complete tasks that can strengthen the cybersecurity posture of an organization.
>- **NIST SP800-61** assists organizations in establishing computer security incident response capabilities and handling incidents efficiently and effectively. This publication provides guidelines for incident handling, particularly for analyzing incident-related data and determining the appropriate response to each incident.
